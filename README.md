## Project from 42 school

This project aim to teach on how to create a multithread program and its perks.
Threads are lightweight process that run independently and allow on program to 
multitask.

So what is the difference between forks and threads?

The main difference is that while forks create a new subprocess a thread use
the same resources as the main process.
